# Markets

Visually simulate markets of basic consumers and producers.

## Random Resource Simulation

- Simulate market dynamics of consumers and producers.
- Consumers move to Producers, get resources, travel home and consume the resources.
- Red means consumer is empty and looking for resources.
- Green means consumer has enough resources to consume.
- Parameters:
  - Number of Consumers
  - Number of Producers
  - Consumers moving rate
  - Consumers demand rate
  - Consumers size
  - Producers production rate
  - Producers maximum inventory
- Data Gathered:
  - Transactions per second
  - Empty Consumers
  - Total Producer Inventory

## Resource Editor

- Manually place position of consumers and producers.
- Each producer and consumer grouping has individual parameters.

## Variable Parameters

- Very similiar to the random simulation.
- Have input parameters controlled via a wave timeline.
